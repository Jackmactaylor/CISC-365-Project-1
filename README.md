Please refer to the question document for details


Experiment 1 (generate random values of 0-n)

for each of the value term where n = 1000, n = 2000, n = 4000, n = 8000, n = 16000
i.e. for 1000, the random number will be within 1000 (number of n)

1. generate 1000 integers, sort into ascending order (use own function) (merge sort)    -   Done
2. search list generation: increase the length of the list by 10, duplicate the number 10 times and shuffle the list
    - n * 10 search list with 10 times the random value, shuffle the list
3. use the binary search to search the value in the array (record time, see document)
4. use the trinary search to search the array for the values (record time, see document)



Experiment 2 (generate with even value and search for odd value)

mathplolib for drawing (create tables or graphs)

Answer the question
1. compare the binary and trinary search
2. compare the two algorithms times
